🧬 Bioinformatic Scripts Repository

Welcome to the Bioinformatics repository! This is a compact yet powerful toolkit of Python scripts designed to perform essential operations on DNA and RNA sequences — tasks that every bioinformatician frequently needs.
Whether you're analyzing a single gene, preprocessing a genomic dataset, or teaching the next generation of sequence scientists, this collection is meant to simplify routine tasks and make your life easier.

🚀 What's Inside
Here’s a quick rundown of the tools currently included:

1.Nucleotide Counter
Count the frequency of A, C, G, and T/U in any DNA or RNA string.

2.DNA to RNA Transcription
Quickly transcribe DNA to RNA (T ➝ U conversion).

3.Reverse Complement
Generate the reverse complement of DNA/RNA sequences.

4.GC Content Calculator
Compute the GC content — a key metric for genome stability and structure.

5.Hamming Distance
Compare two DNA strings and count point mutations.

6.RNA Translation
Convert RNA sequences into amino acid chains using the standard codon table.

7.Motif Finder
Locate all positions of a motif (substring) in a larger DNA sequence.

8.Consensus & Profile Generator
Create a consensus sequence and profile matrix from a set of aligned DNA strings.

🧪 Use Cases
Perfect for students, researchers, and genomics professionals
Can be used in pipelines, teaching material, or for quick exploratory analysis
Easily extendable for more advanced tasks like SNP analysis, ORF detection, or multi-gene analysis

🧠 Coming Soon
FASTA file support
Sequence validation and cleaning
